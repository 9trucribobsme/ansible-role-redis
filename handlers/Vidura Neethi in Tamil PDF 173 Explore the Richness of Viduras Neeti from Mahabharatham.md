## Who is a fool?
 
One of the main themes of Vidura Neethi is to expose the characteristics of a fool, who is ignorant, lazy, arrogant, and harmful to himself and others. Vidura warns Dhritarashtra that he is acting like a fool by favoring his wicked sons over his virtuous nephews, the Pandavas. He also advises him to listen to wise people, to perform his duties diligently, to worship God and ancestors, and to avoid anger and envy.
 
In verses 7 to 14 of the pdf document, Vidura lists eight types of fools who are doomed to suffer in this world and the next. They are:
 
- The one who does not ask questions or learn from others.
- The one who builds castles in the air without any resources or efforts.
- The one who thinks that everything will happen by itself without any action or initiative.
- The one who neglects his own work and envies others' work.
- The one who betrays his friends and relatives.
- The one who considers his enemies as more powerful than himself.
- The one who doubts everything and does not trust anyone.
- The one who postpones what needs to be done urgently and wastes time.

Vidura advises Dhritarashtra to examine himself and see if he has any of these traits of a fool. He also urges him to correct his mistakes and follow the path of wisdom.
 
## How to attain devotion?
 
Another important theme of Vidura Neethi is to explain the benefits of devotion or bhakti, which is the love and surrender to God. Vidura tells Dhritarashtra that devotion is the best way to overcome the sorrows and troubles of life, and to attain peace and happiness. He also says that devotion leads to liberation or moksha, which is the ultimate goal of human existence.
 
In verses 15 to 21 of the pdf document, Vidura describes seven qualities and practices that are essential for attaining devotion. They are:

- Physical purity - keeping the body clean and healthy by bathing, eating wholesome food, and avoiding intoxicants.
- Mental purity - keeping the mind calm and clear by meditating, chanting, and avoiding negative thoughts.
- Humility - acknowledging one's limitations and faults, and seeking guidance from God and guru.
- Service - helping others in need without expecting anything in return.
- Gratitude - expressing thanks to God for everything that happens in life, good or bad.
- Remembrance - remembering God's name, form, qualities, and deeds at all times.
- Praise - singing God's glory and virtues with love and joy.

Vidura advises Dhritarashtra to cultivate these qualities and practices in his life, and to experience the bliss of devotion.
