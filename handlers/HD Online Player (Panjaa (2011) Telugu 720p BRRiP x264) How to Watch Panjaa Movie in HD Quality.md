Some of the negative user reviews are as follows:

> "PANJAA: the first thing that attracted me to this movie is the new makeover of pawan and after seeing this movie the only thing that satisfied me is his makeover. the movie starts with a good deal of titles which increases our enthusiasm about the story but very soon you will realise that the story has nothing new in it coming to the story line ..."[^1^]

> "Panjaa - A stylish disappointment! Panjaa is a stylishly made movie with good cinematography, music and action sequences. But that's about it. The story is weak, predictable and clichÃ©d. The screenplay is slow, boring and lacks entertainment. The dialogues are dull and uninspiring. The characters are poorly developed and uninteresting."[^1^]
