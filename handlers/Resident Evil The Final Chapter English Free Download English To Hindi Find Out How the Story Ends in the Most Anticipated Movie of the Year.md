The film begins with Alice (Milla Jovovich) waking up in the ruins of Washington, D.C., after being betrayed by Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who has taken control of the Umbrella Corporation. She is contacted by the Red Queen (Ever Anderson), the artificial intelligence that runs Umbrella's facilities, who tells her that there is a way to stop the T-virus and save humanity. She reveals that there is an anti-virus hidden in the Hive, Umbrella's underground research facility in Raccoon City, where the virus was first unleashed. The Red Queen also warns Alice that she only has 48 hours before the last human settlements are wiped out by Umbrella's forces.
 
Alice makes her way to Raccoon City, where she encounters a group of survivors led by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), an old ally who was presumed dead. They join forces with another group of rebels, who have a tank and a plan to infiltrate the Hive. Along the way, they face various obstacles and enemies, such as zombie dogs, flying creatures, and mutated monsters. They also discover that Wesker has a secret ally: Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), the original creator of the T-virus, who has cloned himself and commands a horde of undead soldiers.
 
After a fierce battle, Alice and Claire manage to enter the Hive, where they learn the truth about Alice's origin and Umbrella's motives. Alice is actually a clone of Alicia Marcus (also played by Ever Anderson), the daughter of James Marcus and the co-owner of Umbrella. Alicia was infected with the T-virus as a child and has been kept in cryogenic stasis by Wesker, who plans to use her inheritance to rebuild the world in his image after killing all life with the virus. Wesker also reveals that he has disabled the Red Queen and intends to kill Alice and Claire.
 
However, Alice and Claire fight back with the help of the Red Queen, who regains control of the Hive's systems. They confront Wesker and Isaacs in the main chamber, where Alice finds the anti-virus and releases it into the air. The anti-virus kills all infected creatures within range, including Isaacs and his clones. Wesker tries to escape but is crushed by a falling door. Alice survives but loses her superhuman abilities due to the anti-virus.
 
Alice then meets Alicia, who thanks her for saving humanity and gives her a device that contains her childhood memories. Alicia dies peacefully and Alice inherits her identity and wealth. The film ends with Alice riding a motorcycle across a desolate landscape, while narrating that it will take years for the anti-virus to reach every corner of the world. She vows to keep fighting until every last monster is gone.
