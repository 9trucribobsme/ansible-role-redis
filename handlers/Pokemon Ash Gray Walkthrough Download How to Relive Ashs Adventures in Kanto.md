## How to Download Pokemon Ash Gray
 
Pokemon Ash Gray is not an official game, so you will need a few things to play it on your device. First, you will need a Game Boy Advance emulator that can run ROM files. There are many emulators available for different platforms, such as Visual Boy Advance for Windows, My Boy! for Android, or GBA4iOS for iOS. You can search online for the emulator that suits your device and download it from a reputable source.
 
Next, you will need the Pokemon Ash Gray ROM file, which is a modified version of Pokemon Fire Red. You can download it from various websites that host ROM hacks, such as [PokemonROMHacks.com](https://pokemonromhacks.com/pokemon-ash-gray/) or [Pok Universe](https://pokuniverse.com/rom-hacks/pokemon-ash-grey/). Make sure you download the latest version of the game, which is Beta 4.5.3 as of this writing.
 
Once you have both the emulator and the ROM file, you can load the game on your emulator and start playing. Some emulators may require you to unzip the ROM file before loading it, while others can load it directly. You can also transfer the ROM file to your device using a USB cable or a cloud service if you downloaded it on your computer.
