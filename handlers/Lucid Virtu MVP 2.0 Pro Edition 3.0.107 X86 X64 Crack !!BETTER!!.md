## What is GPU virtualization?
 
GPU virtualization is a technology that enables your PC to switch between the integrated graphics and the discrete graphics card dynamically, depending on the workload. This way, you can save power and reduce heat when you are not using intensive applications, and boost performance when you need it. GPU virtualization also allows you to use Intel QuickSync technology to accelerate video encoding up to 600% faster while playing 3D games.
 
## What is Virtual Vsync?
 
Virtual Vsync is a feature that eliminates image tearing for flawless visual quality at any frame rate. Image tearing occurs when the frame rate of the game exceeds the refresh rate of the monitor, resulting in distorted images. Virtual Vsync synchronizes the frame rate of the game with the refresh rate of the monitor, without sacrificing performance or responsiveness.
 
## What is Hyperformance?
 
Hyperformance is a feature that boosts the responsiveness and smoothness of PC gaming by reducing redundant rendering tasks. Hyperformance analyzes the game's rendering pipeline and eliminates unnecessary frames that do not contribute to the final image quality. This way, Hyperformance reduces input lag, mouse lag and CPU overhead, while increasing frame rate and visual quality.
