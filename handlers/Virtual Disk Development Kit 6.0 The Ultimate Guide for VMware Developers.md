Examples of such environments are Citrix Metaframe/Citrix Presentation Server, which delivers applications to multiple users from a central server; NVIDIA Grid, which provides graphics acceleration for virtual desktops; Microsoft App-V, which streams applications to client devices; VMWare, Parallels, and Virtual PC, which allow running multiple operating systems on one computer; and "Thin Clients", which are devices that rely on a server for most of their processing. InDesign has certain technical support limitations for these types of environments.
  
3. InDesign is a desktop publishing software that allows users to create and edit print and digital publications, such as books, magazines, flyers, and ebooks. InDesign offers various features and tools for layout design, typography, graphics, interactivity, and collaboration. InDesign is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite of applications, which also includes Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat, and others.

4. InDesign is designed to run on a local computer with a standard operating system and hardware configuration. Running InDesign in a virtualized or server-based environment may cause performance issues, compatibility problems, licensing errors, or other unexpected behaviors. Some of these issues may be resolved by adjusting the settings of the virtualization software or the server, but some may not be supported by Adobe technical support.
  
5. If you want to use InDesign in a virtualized or server-based environment, you should check the system requirements and the technical support boundaries for InDesign before installing or launching the software. You should also consult the documentation and the support resources of the virtualization software or the server provider to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements for running InDesign. You should also be aware of the potential risks and limitations of using InDesign in such an environment and be prepared to troubleshoot any problems that may arise.
