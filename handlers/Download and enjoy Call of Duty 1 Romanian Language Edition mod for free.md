The mod was created by GavTutorials101, a YouTube channel that uploads walkthroughs and tutorials for various games. The mod covers the entire game, including the training mission and all the levels of the three campaigns. You can watch some of the videos on their channel to see how the mod works and how it sounds.
 
If you want to install the mod, you will need to have Call of Duty 1 installed on your PC first. Then, you will need to download the mod files from this link: [Call Of Duty 1 Romanian Language Edition Misiunea 1-Training\[Fara comentariu\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZl_Ajk7TiE). The link will take you to the first video of the walkthrough series, where you can find the download link in the description. The mod files are in a zip archive, so you will need to extract them using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
