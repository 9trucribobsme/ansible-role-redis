The game's main selling point is its historical setting and its authentic Vietnamese voice acting. The game aims to portray the war from the perspective of the Vietnamese people and their struggle for independence. However, the game also suffers from many technical and design flaws that make it a frustrating and disappointing experience.
 
Some of the problems include poor graphics, buggy animations, inconsistent AI, linear and repetitive level design, lack of variety in weapons and enemies, and a short and uninspired campaign. The game also lacks any multiplayer mode or co-op feature, which reduces its replay value. The game received mostly negative reviews from critics and players alike, who criticized its low production quality and lack of polish.
 
7554 is a game that had potential to be a unique and immersive historical shooter, but failed to deliver on its promises. The game is not worth buying or downloading, even if it is offered for free with a crack. There are many other better shooters available on the market that offer more fun and satisfaction.

If you are still curious about the game and its setting, here are some more details that you might find interesting. The game's campaign consists of 10 missions that span from 1946 to 1954. The missions are based on real historical events and battles, such as the Battle of Hanoi, the Battle of Vinh Yen, and the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The game also features some famous historical figures, such as Ho Chi Minh, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Henri Navarre.
 
The game tries to recreate the atmosphere and the challenges of the war, such as the harsh terrain, the weather conditions, the lack of resources, and the guerrilla tactics. The game also tries to convey the emotions and the motivations of the Viet Minh soldiers and their leaders, who fought for their freedom and their homeland. The game's soundtrack consists of Vietnamese patriotic songs and folk music that add to the immersion.
 
However, these efforts are undermined by the game's poor execution and quality. The game's graphics are outdated and bland, with low-resolution textures, low-poly models, and low-quality effects. The game's animations are stiff and unnatural, with characters moving awkwardly and clipping through objects. The game's AI is erratic and unpredictable, with enemies either being too easy or too hard to kill. The game's level design is linear and boring, with little room for exploration or creativity. The game's weapons and enemies are generic and repetitive, with no real difference in performance or behavior.
 
The game's campaign is short and dull, with no memorable moments or surprises. The game's story is poorly told and poorly paced, with no character development or emotional impact. The game's voice acting is authentic but also amateurish and inconsistent, with some actors sounding bored or overacting. The game's subtitles are also full of grammatical errors and mistranslations.
 
7554 is a game that tried to do something different and original, but failed miserably in every aspect. The game is a waste of time and money, and a disrespect to the history and the people it tried to represent. The game is not worth playing or downloading, even if it is free with a crack.
