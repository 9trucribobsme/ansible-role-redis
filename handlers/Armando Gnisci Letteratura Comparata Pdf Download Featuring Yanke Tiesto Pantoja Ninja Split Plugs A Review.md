In his works, Gnisci challenges the Eurocentric and hegemonic models of literary studies and proposes a dialogical and reciprocal approach that recognizes the diversity and plurality of literary cultures. He also advocates for a global and intercultural perspective that explores the connections and interactions between different literary traditions and histories. He is especially interested in the literature of the Mediterranean, Africa, Latin America, and Asia, as well as in the themes of migration, diaspora, hybridity, and resistance.

Comparative Literature Examples
 
One of the advantages of studying comparative literature is that it exposes you to a variety of texts from different languages, cultures, genres, and media. You can discover new perspectives, connections, and insights by comparing and contrasting different works of literature. Here are some examples of comparative literature projects that you might encounter or pursue:

1. A comparison of the epic genre in ancient Greece and India, focusing on Homer's *Iliad* and Valmiki's *Ramayana*.
2. A study of the influence of French symbolism on Latin American modernist poetry, examining poets like RubÃ©n DarÃ­o, Leopoldo Lugones, and CÃ©sar Vallejo.
3. An analysis of the representation of gender and sexuality in Gothic novels and films, such as Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, Bram Stoker's *Dracula*, Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho*, and Anne Rice's *Interview with the Vampire*.
4. A exploration of the concept of world literature and its implications for literary criticism, drawing on works by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, David Damrosch, Pascale Casanova, and Franco Moretti.
5. A critique of the postcolonial theory and practice of writing back to the empire, using examples from Chinua Achebe's *Things Fall Apart*, Jean Rhys' *Wide Sargasso Sea*, Salman Rushdie's *Midnight's Children*, and J.M. Coetzee's *Foe*.

As you can see, comparative literature is a rich and diverse field that offers many possibilities for research and learning. If you are interested in expanding your horizons and engaging with different literary traditions and cultures, comparative literature might be the right choice for you.
