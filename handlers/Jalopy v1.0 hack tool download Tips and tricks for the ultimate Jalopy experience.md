## Jalopy Tips and Tricks: How to Survive and Thrive in the Car Simulator Game
 
Jalopy is not just a car simulator game, it's also a survival game. You have to deal with various challenges and dangers as you drive your jalopy across Eastern Europe, such as weather, traffic, border controls, car breakdowns, fuel shortages and more. You also have to manage your inventory and budget wisely, as you can only carry so much stuff and money is hard to come by.
 
Fortunately, there are some tips and tricks that can help you survive and thrive in Jalopy. Here are some of them:

- Items and boxes may be brought into the vehicle with you. Drop them near the door, then pick them up again once seated. This way, you only carry the largest items with you when your trunk and a top rack are full, and you can even put items in the store baskets, and carry them around this way[^1^].
- You can add oil to fuel canisters which you can then carry with you. It saves 2 inventory spaces. Ran out of gas? Open the driver-side door and activate and hold the steering wheel. You are now pushing your car[^1^].
- Got lots of little stuff that needs to be sold to the station? Grab a basket or three and load those up. Each basket holds 12 inventory slots and counts as one item held. Better yet? The cashier will buy pretty much all the stuff in the basket at once[^1^].
- Looking for a specific upgrade or decal or paint? Sleep at the motel then keeps saving and reloading. Each time will cycle the inventory of the Laika Dealer, bringing in fresh stock[^1^].
- Fall through the world? Happens to the best of us. But falling forever is not very conducive to gameplay am I right? Two ways to fix it, use the map to drive home (How on earth?) or hit escape and click return home. Both take you back to Uncle Comrade's house[^1^].
- Making money: The non-exploit way. Easy way to make loads of money, without using exploits? Hold on to any wine or pharmaceuticals you get. Don't sell them right away, unless you see that the buying price is 00.00. Why? That means you are in a country that does not allow these things across their borders, and you're going to get top dollar for them. Pills seem to cap at 40 marks a bottle, and Wine at over a hundred. Each time you select a route, check your pills and your wine bottles[^1^].
- Do your cars keep breaking down? Believe it or not, that's ok! The worse condition a part is, the more likely you are to find a replacement. My experience? The replacement is often leaps and bounds better than the broken part[^1^]!
- Can't stay on the road to save your life? Put tires with the best grip for the conditions on the front. Will dramatically improve handling[^1^].
- To wash your car, pick up the sponge at the gas station and dunk it in the bucket (aim for the middle of the water and make sure the bucket is not highlighted or you will pick it up). Use the sponge three times on your car (won't 'sploosh' unless the part you're targeting is dirty) and then dunk it three times in the bucket. Repeat until car is clean[^2^].
- If you leave your passenger window down, you can reach your wallet from outside the car without opening the door (the sound from the engine may drive you crazy though)[^2^].
- When you Return Home, fit the new tires (and engine parts if applicable) to your car, repair and fill it up, and select a route and drive out of the now-open gate. Then immediately Return Home again. Everything will be replenished so you can pack up the spare tires, repair kit, gas and oil, etc. for the upcoming trip[^2^]. Of course this is a bit cheaty so don't do it if you want to experience the grind.
- Don't drive in the rain if you can help it. It's terrible even with 'wet' tires[^2^].
