# Global Strategic Management by Mike W. Peng: A Comprehensive and Practical Guide for Managers
 
Global strategic management is the process of designing and implementing strategies that enable organizations to compete effectively and successfully in the global marketplace. It involves analyzing the opportunities and challenges of globalization, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the firm, choosing the best modes of entry and expansion, and managing the complexities and risks of cross-border operations.

One of the leading books on this topic is *Global Strategic Management* by Mike W. Peng, a professor of global strategy at the University of Texas at Dallas. This book provides a clear insight into the corporate strategies of organizations operating on a global scale and explains the analysis, decision-making, and development processes behind securing competitive advantage. It also offers a diverse range of case studies that illustrate strategic management theory in a real-world context, as well as encourage critical reflection and discussion of key ideas.
 
The book covers various aspects of global strategic management, such as:
 
- The nature and drivers of globalization
- The institutional and cultural diversity of the global environment
- The resource-based and institution-based views of strategy
- The industry- and firm-level analyses of global competition
- The entry modes and alliance strategies for international expansion
- The organizational design and control issues for global operations
- The corporate governance and social responsibility challenges for global managers
- The innovation and entrepreneurship opportunities in the global economy

The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses on global strategy and strategic management, as well as for managers who want to enhance their knowledge and skills in this field. It is also supported by a fully integrated online resource center that provides additional materials for students and instructors, such as multiple-choice questions, weblinks, PowerPoint slides, case study solutions, and more.

One of the main strengths of *Global Strategic Management* by Mike W. Peng is its integration of both the resource-based and the institution-based views of strategy. The resource-based view focuses on the internal capabilities and resources of the firm, such as human capital, technology, brand, and culture, and how they can be leveraged to create and sustain competitive advantage. The institution-based view emphasizes the external factors that shape the strategic choices and actions of the firm, such as formal rules, informal norms, and cultural values, and how they can be adapted to or influenced by the firm.
 
By combining these two perspectives, the book offers a more comprehensive and balanced understanding of global strategic management. It also helps managers to avoid the pitfalls of over-relying on either view and to recognize the interplay and complementarity between them. For example, the book shows how firms can use their resources to exploit the opportunities and overcome the challenges of different institutional environments, as well as how they can leverage their institutional legitimacy and networks to access and acquire valuable resources.
 
Another strength of *Global Strategic Management* by Mike W. Peng is its inclusion of emerging and developing economies in the analysis of global competition. The book acknowledges that the global economy is not dominated by developed countries alone, but also by emerging and developing countries that have different levels of economic development, political stability, legal systems, and cultural diversity. The book examines how these countries present both opportunities and threats for global firms, and how global firms can adopt different strategies to compete with or cooperate with local firms in these markets.
 
The book also showcases the success stories and best practices of firms from emerging and developing economies that have become global players in their own right. These firms demonstrate how they have leveraged their local advantages, such as low-cost labor, abundant natural resources, large domestic markets, or unique cultural heritage, to create value and differentiation in the global marketplace. They also illustrate how they have overcome their local disadvantages, such as weak institutions, poor infrastructure, or low innovation capabilities, to improve their efficiency and quality in the global marketplace.
