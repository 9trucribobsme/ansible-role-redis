## What is Escape from Mos Shuuta?
 
Escape from Mos Shuuta is an adventure that was originally published by Fantasy Flight Games for their Star Wars roleplaying game system. It was later converted to SW5e by GM Binder, a website that allows you to create and share custom content for tabletop roleplaying games. Escape from Mos Shuuta is designed for four level 1 characters, but can be adjusted for parties of a different size.
 
The adventure takes place in Mos Shuuta, a small city on the desert world of Tatooine. Mos Shuuta is situated on the top of a tall, rocky bluff, with nothing but endless desert in every direction around it. As the story begins, the player characters are attempting to escape the servants of the ruler of Mos Shuuta, Teemo the Hutt. Each of the player characters is in trouble with Teemo the Hutt for one reason or another. The only way to get off the planet and escape Teemo the Hutt is to steal a ship and fly to safety. Fortunately, they'll get a chance to do exactly that, by stealing a ship called the Krayt Fang from a Trandoshan named Trex.
 
The adventure is presented as a series of encounters that introduce different aspects of the SW5e system, such as combat, skill checks, exploration, social interaction, and space combat. The adventure also includes a map of Mos Shuuta and its locations, such as the cantina, the junk shop, the spaceport control, and the landing bay. The adventure is full of action, suspense, humor, and Star Wars flavor.
