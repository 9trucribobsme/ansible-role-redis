Mafia II is a game that lets you experience the life of a gangster in the 1940s and 1950s. You play as Vito Scaletta, a war veteran who gets involved with the Mafia to pay off his father's debts and rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld. You can explore the open world of Empire Bay, a fictional city based on New York, and engage in various missions, shootouts, car chases, and stealth sequences.
 
The game was originally released in 2010 by 2K Games and received positive reviews for its story, characters, and atmosphere. However, some fans were disappointed by the lack of content and features compared to the first Mafia game. That's why Mr DJ, a popular repacker of PC games, has created a special version of Mafia II that includes all the DLCs (downloadable content) that were released for the game. These DLCs add new story chapters, outfits, vehicles, weapons, and gameplay modes to the game.
