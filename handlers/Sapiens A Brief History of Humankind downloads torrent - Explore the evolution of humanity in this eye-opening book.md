The book has received widespread acclaim from critics and readers alike, who praised Harari's ability to weave together a captivating narrative of human history with insights from various disciplines. The Guardian called it a "thrilling story, dark message" [^1^] and a "swash-buckling account that begins with the origin of the species and ends with post-humans" [^3^].

Many reviewers appreciated Harari's clear and engaging writing style, his original and provocative perspectives, and his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and assumptions.
 
However, the book also faced some criticism and controversy from some scholars and experts, who questioned Harari's accuracy, methodology, and biases. Some accused him of oversimplifying complex phenomena, cherry-picking evidence, making sweeping generalizations, and ignoring alternative viewpoints. Others argued that he was too pessimistic, cynical, or deterministic in his outlook on human history and future. Some also pointed out factual errors, logical flaws, or ideological agendas in his arguments. For example, historian J.M. Roberts wrote a scathing review of the book in The Spectator, calling it "a shallow account of where we are now" and "a work of astonishing intellectual arrogance" .
 
Despite these criticisms, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind remains a popular and influential book that has sparked many debates and discussions among readers around the world. It has also inspired a sequel by Harari titled Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, which explores the possible future scenarios for humanity in the 21st century and beyond.
