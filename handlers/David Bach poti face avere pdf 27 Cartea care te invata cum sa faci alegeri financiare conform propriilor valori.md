One of the key concepts that David Bach teaches in his book is the power of compound interest. Compound interest is the interest that you earn on your interest. It means that your money grows faster and faster over time, as long as you keep it invested. This is how you can turn a small amount of money into a large fortune.
 
For example, if you invest $100 at a 10% annual interest rate, you will have $110 after one year. But if you leave that money invested for another year, you will have $121, not just $120. That extra $1 is the compound interest. And if you keep doing this for 10 years, you will have $259.37, more than double your initial investment. And if you do it for 40 years, you will have $4,526.87, more than 45 times your initial investment.

That is why David Bach says that the best time to start investing is yesterday. The sooner you start, the more time you have to benefit from compound interest. And the more money you invest, the more compound interest you earn. That is why he recommends saving at least 10% of your income and investing it in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
 
But what if you feel like you don't have enough money to save and invest? What if you are living paycheck to paycheck and barely making ends meet? That is where another concept that David Bach teaches comes in handy: the latte factor.
