## What is WinCircuit 2002?
 
WinCircuit 2002 is a program developed by Alain MICHEL, a French engineer and software developer. It was released in 2002 as an improved version of WinCircuit, which was first launched in 1998. WinCircuit 2002 is compatible with Windows XP and Windows 7, and it has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to learn and use. WinCircuit 2002 can be downloaded from [here](https://en.freedownloadmanager.org/Windows-PC/WinCircuit.html) for a free trial or purchased for $35.
 
## How to Use WinCircuit 2002 to Design Printed Circuits?
 
WinCircuit 2002 has two main modes: drawing mode and routing mode. Drawing mode allows you to draw the components and the copper layers of your circuit, while routing mode allows you to create the traces of connections and the drilling templates. Here are the steps to use WinCircuit 2002 to design printed circuits:

1. Open WinCircuit 2002 and create a new file. You can choose the size and the resolution of your circuit board, as well as the number of layers (one or two).
2. In drawing mode, select the components you want to use from the library or create your own components using the editor. You can also import components from other files or programs. Drag and drop the components onto your circuit board and arrange them as you wish. You can also draw rectangular and triangular surfaces to fill the copper layers.
3. In routing mode, select the layer you want to work on (top or bottom) and click on the auto-routing button to let WinCircuit 2002 generate the traces of connections automatically. You can also draw the traces manually using the mouse or the keyboard. You can adjust the width, the clearance, and the shape of the traces as needed.
4. In routing mode, you can also create the drilling templates by clicking on the drill button. WinCircuit 2002 will show you where to drill holes for your components and vias. You can modify the diameter and the position of the holes as needed.
5. When you are done with your design, you can save your file in various formats, such as BMP, DXF, GERBER, HPGL, or PDF. You can also print your circuit board or export it to other programs for further processing.

## Conclusion
 
WinCircuit 2002 is a useful program for designing printed circuits in single or double layers. It has a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to draw components, copper layers, traces of connections, and drilling templates with ease and accuracy. You can also use WinCircuit 2002 to test your circuit before printing it or sending it to a manufacturer. WinCircuit 2002 is a great tool for anyone who is interested in electronics and wants to create their own printed circuits.
