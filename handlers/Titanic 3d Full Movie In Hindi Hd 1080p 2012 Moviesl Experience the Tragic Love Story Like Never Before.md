- The film was shot on a full-scale replica of the Titanic, which was built at a cost of $200 million in Mexico. The replica was 90% accurate to the original ship, except for some modifications for safety and filming purposes. The replica was also mounted on a giant platform that could tilt and sink into a 17-million-gallon tank of water.[^1^]
- The film features many real-life characters and events that happened on board the Titanic, such as the musicians who played until the end, the wireless operators who sent distress signals, the baker who survived by drinking alcohol, and the Unsinkable Molly Brown who helped row a lifeboat. Some of the dialogue was also taken from actual transcripts and testimonies of the survivors.[^1^]
- The film's iconic scene where Jack and Rose stand at the bow of the ship and he says \"I'm the king of the world!\" was improvised by Leonardo DiCaprio on the spot. The line was not in the script, but James Cameron liked it so much that he kept it in the film. It later became one of the most famous movie quotes of all time.[^1^]
- The film's love theme song \"My Heart Will Go On\" sung by Celine Dion was almost not included in the film. James Cameron initially did not want any songs in his film, but composer James Horner secretly recorded a demo with Dion and played it for Cameron, who was moved to tears and agreed to use it. The song became a huge hit and won an Oscar for Best Original Song.[^2^]
- The film's 3D conversion was done with meticulous care and attention to detail by James Cameron and his team. They used a process called rotoscoping to separate each element in each frame and adjust its depth and position in 3D space. They also corrected some historical inaccuracies and visual errors that were present in the original film, such as the alignment of the stars in the night sky.[^2^]

If you are a fan of Titanic or want to relive the magic of this timeless masterpiece, don't miss the chance to watch Titanic 3D in theaters or online. You will be amazed by how realistic and immersive it feels to be on board the ship of dreams.
