## Step 2: Run World of Warcraft and cheat engine
 
Launch World of Warcraft and log in to your account on a private server that allows hacking. Then, run cheat engine as administrator and click on the computer icon on the top left corner. A window will pop up with a list of processes running on your computer. Find wow.exe and select it, then click Open.
 
## Step 3: Scan for your damage value
 
Now you need to find the address that stores your damage value in the game's memory. To do this, you need to perform a scan using cheat engine. First, go to your character's stats panel and note down your current damage value (for example, 5000). Then, go back to cheat engine and enter that value in the Value box. Make sure the Scan Type is set to Exact Value and the Value Type is set to 4 Bytes. Then click First Scan.
 
Cheat engine will scan the game's memory and display a list of addresses that match your value. There will be many results, so you need to narrow them down by changing your damage value in the game and scanning again. To do this, go back to World of Warcraft and equip or unequip an item that affects your damage (for example, a weapon or a trinket). Then note down your new damage value (for example, 5200) and go back to cheat engine. Enter that value in the Value box and click Next Scan.
 
Repeat this process until you have only one or a few results left in the list. These are the addresses that store your damage value in the game's memory.
 
## Step 4: Change your damage value
 
Now that you have found the address that stores your damage value, you can change it to whatever you want by double-clicking on it. A window will pop up where you can enter a new value (for example, 50000). Click OK and go back to World of Warcraft. You will see that your damage value has changed in your stats panel.
 
This means that you have successfully hacked wow 4.3.4 damage using cheat engine. However, this hack is not permanent and will reset when you log out or change zones. To make it permanent, you need to freeze the address in cheat engine.
 
## Step 5: Freeze your damage value
 
To freeze your damage value, you need to check the box next to the address in cheat engine's list. This will prevent the game from changing it back to its original value. You can also change the color of the address by right-clicking on it and selecting Change Color.
 
Now you have hacked
